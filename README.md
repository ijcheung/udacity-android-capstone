# udacity-android-capstone

Adds Udacity required functionality (Tablet Layout, Google Analytics, RTL support,
AppBarLayout, and Widget) to my personal Android project:
[Karaokyo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karaokyo.android.app.player).

Karaokyo is a lyric overlay app. Now you can surf the net or play your
Angry Birds with your lyrics at your fingertips.
